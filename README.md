# Charitree

## A donation app that uses blockchain to enforce transparency | HawkHacks 2024

With ChariTree, charities and donations are no longer a black box. Using our own subnet, we allow users to donate cryptocurrency, view exactly how charities spend their money, and keep track of their donation metrics. With the immutability of transactions and transparent nature, ChariTree instills trust between people and businesses one block at a time.

Overall, even besides blockchain, our team had to learn a whole suite of new skills. From using Django's user authentication with PostgreSQL to translating visions to VS code blocks with Tailwind CSS, it was truly a journey.

As for next steps, stay tuned! We definitely have more tracking and analytics features in mind, not to mention making our React app truly decentralized. Here are some of the basics
- Deploying our subnet onto a test mainnet
- Filter and search for charities listed on our page as the database grows
- Seeing a distribution of your donation between various industries, causes, and over time
- Professional auditing team to track the wallet's linked to various charities and causes
- The ability to track the motion of individual coins rather than a broader view
- How to make this accessible/feasible to use for those in less developed countries
- Good samaritan points or dashboards built into the community

Huge thanks to the team and for struggling together
